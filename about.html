		<h1>About Pretty Weird Art</h1>
		<p>Pretty Weird Art is the public face of illustrators Ethan and Rachel Mongin. Ethan and Rachel are a couple of self-diagnosed, obsessive-compulsive art makers who love comics, children's literature, and illustration. They are a tag-team dynamic duo who write and illustrate comics, conduct elementary school comic book clubs, and who work as freelance illustrators in Columbia, SC. When they aren’t selling artwork at <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/schedule.html">comic book conventions</a>,  Ethan works as a freelance illustrator and Rachel works as an elementary school teacher.  Occasionally, they are joined by their writing buddy, Mark Szasz, on their creative excursions.</p>

		<p>If you’d like to talk to Ethan or Rachel, they can be reached through <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/contact.html">email</a> or on <a href="{{ site.facebook }}">Facebook</a>.</p>
