			<h4>We're Awesome. It's True.</h4>
			<p style="margin-top:-8px;">You've seen our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/gallery.html">artworks</a>. You know we draw <strong>Ninja Turtles</strong> fighting <strong>GI Joes</strong>. You know that <em>Batman</em>, <em>Jason</em>, and other cinematic and comic book legends have graced the walls of our digital galleries. What could have possessed you to even <strong>want</strong> to know anything more about us?</p>
			<p><em><strong>We're AWESOME, Ok?!!</strong></em> That's it. That's all you need to know about us. Trust us. We can go on about all the <strong><em>booooring</em></strong> details about how we grew up here and got "Eh-joo-kate-ed" there. We can even write about all the things our therapists have grown bored of hearing about. And it would bore you to tears, too. It really would. Ok, OK. Just because we've written about some of it doesn't mean you're not interested in hearing it. Go ahead and read it. But don't say we didn't warn you.</p>

			<h4 style="margin-top:24px;">You didn't hear it from us.</h4>
			<p style="margin-top: -8px;">Pretty Weird Art is the public face of illustrators Ethan and Rachel Mongin. Ethan and Rachel are a couple of self-diagnosed, obsessive-compulsive art makers who love comics, children's literature, and illustration. They are a tag-team dynamic duo who write and illustrate <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/comics/html" description="For someone's sake! Visit our comics page already!">comics</a>, conduct elementary school comic book clubs, and who work as freelance illustrators in Columbia, SC. When they arenâ€™t selling artwork at <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/schedule.html">comic book conventions</a>,  Ethan works as a freelance illustrator and Rachel works as an elementary school teacher.  Occasionally, they are joined by their writing buddy, Mark Szasz, on their creative excursions.</p>
			<h4 style="margin-top: 24px;">It's all a ruse.</h4>
			<p style="margin-top:-8px;">Now we know you want to <strong>get in touch</strong> with us, don't you? Head on over to our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/contact.html">contact</a>* page to send us an <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/contact.html">email</a> or drop by our <a href="{{ site.facebook }}">Facebook</a>* page and leave a comment. We're such interesting people, aren't we?</p> <p><em style="font-size:65%;">*We know you want to talk to us so much at this point that we linked up our contact page twice. ;)</em></p>
