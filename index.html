		<p>Pretty Weird Art is the public face of illustrators Ethan and Rachel Mongin. Ethan and Rachel are a couple of self-diagnosed, obsessive-compulsive art makers who love comics, children's literature, and illustration. They are a tag-team dynamic duo who write and illustrate comics, conduct elementary school comic book clubs, and who work as freelance illustrators in Columbia, SC.
