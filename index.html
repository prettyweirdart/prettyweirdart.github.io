<h3>About Pretty Weird Art</h3>
<p>Pretty Weird Art is the public face of illustrators Ethan and Rachel Mongin. Ethan and Rachel are a couple of self-diagnosed, obsessive-compulsive art makers who love comics, children's literature, and illustration. They are a tag-team dynamic duo who write and illustrate comics, conduct elementary school comic book clubs, and who work as freelance illustrators in Columbia, SC. When they arenâ€™t selling artwork at comic book conventions,  Ethan works as a freelance illustrator and Rachel works as an elementary school teacher.  Occasionally, they are joined by their writing buddy, Mark Szasz, on their creative excursions.</p>
